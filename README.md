# RPG_console_game
Short console RPG written in C++

It was a project for one of my university courses. The only thing I wasn't responsible for was the fighting system. 
I've spent quite some time thinking how to make equipment feel enjoyable and smooth. Without using any tutorials and still being a newbie I managed to achieve a 
satisfying result. The equipment felt good, had nice interface despite being fully shown in console. The items system using classes also worked well, equiping and 
taking items off was working like I wanted it to work, the equipment could be navigated using wasd or arrow keys, which was my main goal. I also figured out how to make 
the character move through the maps, pick up items and interact with enemies
